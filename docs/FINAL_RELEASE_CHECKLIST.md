# Final submission and release checklist

Last local validation: 3 August 2026.

> Historical record of the v1.1.x release cycle. The submission target was changed on
> 2026-09-04 to *EPJ Quantum Technology*; see `EPJQT_EDITORIAL_ADAPTATION.md`.

Target: *npj Quantum Information*, Collection “Quantum machine learning:
understanding capabilities, limitations, and perspectives for quantum
advantage”. Baseline artifact: immutable v1.1.5, DOI
`10.5281/zenodo.21764577`. Final release: v1.1.6, DOI
`10.5281/zenodo.21776862`.

## Completed repository curation

- [x] Removed unreferenced internal plans, roadmaps, simulated-review notes,
  historical release checklists, an obsolete venue converter, and superseded
  release-planning material.
- [x] Preserved every frozen scientific specification, prediction lock,
  separated label, opening record, manifest, checksum, failure record, result,
  table, figure, and reproduction dependency byte-for-byte.
- [x] Replaced the machine-specific network-flow data default with the required
  portable `--source-data-root` argument and documented it.
- [x] Corrected `.gitignore`, kept the local cover letter private, and protected
  the untracked private plan from `git add .` without ignoring scientific files.
- [x] Added a compact artifact map and documented the roles of GitHub, Zenodo,
  costly frozen inputs, quick validation, and full reproduction.

## Completed editorial closure

- [x] Added source-verified bibliography for partial identification;
  transductive minimax aggregation; active, multi-model, and OOD evaluation;
  finite-shot complexity; and recent QML hardware evidence.
- [x] Kept the exact scope: a fixed candidate versus the best member of a
  prespecified fixed family on a finite batch under unrestricted label
  completions.
- [x] Replaced “information optimality” with “sharpness and minimality” and
  stated that the adaptive update is pathwise exact after any realized audit
  subset.

- [x] Replaced “sharp identified set” with statistically precise interval
  terminology.
- [x] Added Slattery et al., *Phys. Rev. A* **107**, 062417 (2023), and
  distinguished global kernel approximation from the target-batch certificate.
- [x] Scoped Gate 2 throughout to the prespecified classical-kernel reference
  family.
- [x] Replaced categorical prospective-transfer language with the factual
  two-task result and its predefined criteria.
- [x] Removed public-facing review-history language and renamed the current
  circuit/protocol sensitivity figure file neutrally.
- [x] Renamed Figure 4 “Descriptive target-label-free family contrasts in
  eight fixed scenario-groups.”
- [x] Kept the npj cover letter within the 350--450 word validation window.
- [x] Applied a conservative main-text prune while retaining every
  reproducibility-critical method and all ten permitted display items.
- [x] Corrected bibliography metadata and regenerated the bibliography.
- [x] Recorded the applicable determination that this secondary analysis falls
  outside institutional ethics review; stated factually that ethics approval
  and additional informed consent were not required, without claiming approval
  or exemption.

## Validation record

- [x] Main manuscript compiled: 59 pages; no undefined citations or
  references; no overfull boxes.
- [x] Supplementary Information compiled: 15 pages; no undefined references;
  no overfull boxes.
- [x] Manuscript validators v0.8--v1.1 passed.
- [x] v0.7 and v0.8 artifact-integrity validators passed.
- [x] Full test suite passed: 120 tests.
- [x] CLI smoke suite passed.
- [x] Visual audit completed for all 74 pages.
- [x] Candidate submission checksums recorded in the submission package.

## Ethics determination

- [x] The applicable determination is that the study falls outside the scope
  of institutional ethics review because it consists exclusively of secondary
  analyses of publicly available, deidentified datasets, without recruitment,
  interaction, intervention, access to direct identifiers, or any attempt at
  reidentification.
- [x] No committee, approval, exemption, reference, or date is asserted.

The ethics blocker is closed. The exact closed validation set must pass before
the tested v1.1.6 files are committed, tagged, and published without further
scientific or editorial changes.
